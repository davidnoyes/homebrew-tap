# The Homebrew cask, as a template.

# It lives here rather than only in the tap so that there is one copy to read
# and edit, and so the tap can be bootstrapped by hand. The release workflow
# fills in the two placeholders and writes the result to Casks/ezdisplay.rb in
# the tap repository, which is what `brew install` reads.
#
# To bootstrap the tap by hand, after a release exists:
#
#     version=1.0.0
#     sha=$(shasum -a 256 EZDisplay-${version}.zip | cut -d' ' -f1)
#     sed -e "s/1.0.3/${version}/" -e "s/840ebf5c567ccd6aa82f286fc3f814ca090c2091bcd50c61324469f07dd8ec43/${sha}/" etc/ezdisplay.rb \
#         > ../homebrew-tap/Casks/ezdisplay.rb
#
# The placeholders are quoted strings, so this file parses as Ruby either way
# and `ruby -c` is a real check on it.

  # EZDisplay updates itself from its About panel. This records that, but it no
  # longer keeps `brew upgrade` away: since Homebrew 6.0 an auto-updating cask
  # is upgraded whenever the tap is newer than the version Homebrew reads out of
  # the installed bundle. Measured against 6.0.22, plain `brew upgrade` takes
  # EZDisplay, and no `--greedy` is needed.
  #
  # Reading the bundle rather than its own receipt is what makes that safe, and
  # it is the reason to keep this stanza: after the app has updated itself,
  # Homebrew sees the new version on disk and leaves it alone instead of
  # reinstalling over the top. Anyone who wants Homebrew to keep away entirely
  # sets HOMEBREW_NO_UPGRADE_AUTO_UPDATES_CASKS=1.

  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    EZDisplay is signed by its own certificate rather than by an Apple one, so
    macOS refuses the first launch. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security,
    find the message naming EZDisplay, and choose Open Anyway. That is once per
    machine: every release is signed by the same certificate.

    To let EZDisplay control the volume keys, grant it Accessibility in
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
